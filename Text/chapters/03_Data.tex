While all analyses in this discussion are performed by the author, if not indicated otherwise, the raw data is collected from a variety of sources. Since the project can be divided into two distinctive parts, the classification of open market operations and yield curve movements, the origin of the data is disclosed below in a similar fashion.

\subsection{Financial time series}
Federal Funds target rates as well as major announcements delivered by the board are taken from the website of the Federal Reserve \parencite{Fed.OMOs} as well as \textcite{Fawley.2013} and newspaper articles as collected by the Factiva database. The daily yield curve utilized is provided by Thompson Reuters Datastream. Figure~\vref{fig:TgtvsInt} compares the Federal Funds target rate (range) to the daily constant maturity US treasury 1M middle rate. Vertical lines indicate extraordinary announcements by the Fed board as described in section~\ref{sec:Lit} that had a significant impact on financial markets.

% Fed target history, analyses about yield curve movements -> graph in descriptives?
Table~\vref{tab:FEDfundstgt} lists all absolute Fed target rate changes during the sample period, one-day relative changes in market interest rates as well as the final classification as described in section~\ref{sec:Meth}. The sample ranges from January,~1st 2002 until June,~27th 2017, implying 4,040 changes in the yield curve of which 33 took place during a target rate adjustment of the Fed.

\subsection{Articles and text}
The final dataset contains 834 newspaper articles of different length in English language from Bloomberg, Financial Times, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones Newswires, AFX, Market News International, the Associated Press and others as collected from the Factiva database from which 9,017 terms are extracted for the analysis. Figures~\ref{fig:ExArticle_1} and \vref{fig:ExArticle_2} in the appendix serve as examples of how the articles look like. For demonstration purposes, comparatively short snippets have been chosen here. In order to read them into the software, all articles have been converted to simple text files for which all descriptive content in the beginning has been discarded. The sample spans across 33 Fed target rate adjustments for which between 11 and 52 articles of varying length have been analysed, respectively.
