While all analyses in this discussion are performed by the author, if not indicated otherwise, the raw data is collected from a variety of sources. Since the project can be divided into two distinctive parts, the classification of open market operations and yield curve movements, the origin of the data is disclosed below in a similar fashion.

\subsection{Financial time series}
Federal funds target rates as well as major announcements delivered by the board are taken from the website of the Federal Reserve \cite{Fed.OMOs} as well as \textcite{Fawley.2013} and newspaper articles as collected by the Factiva database. The daily yield curve utilized is provided by Thompson Reuters Datastream. Figure~\vref{fig:TgtvsInt} compares the Federal Funds target rate (range) to the daily constant maturity US treasury middle rate. Vertical lines indicate extraordinary announcements by the Fed board as described in section~\ref{sec:Lit} that had a significant impact on financial markets.

% Fed target history, analyses about yield curve movements -> graph in descriptives?

Table~\vref{tab:FEDfundstgt} lists all absolute Fed target rate changes during the sample period, one-day relative changes in market interest rates as well as the final classification. The sample ranges from January,~1st 2002 until June,~27th 2017, implying 4040 changes in the yield curve of which 33 took place during a target rate adjustment of the Fed.

\subsection{Articles and text}
The final dataset contains newspaper articles in English language from Bloomberg, Financial Times, Reuters and Wall Street Journal in text format from an extensive database. Since the scope and quality of these articles is only useful for the years past 2007, a few comparable articles have been added from the Factiva database in order to make analyses before the year 2007 feasible and meaningful. Figures~\vref{fig:ExArticle_1} and \vref{fig:ExArticle_2} serve as examples of how the articles from Factiva look like. For demonstration purposes, comparatively short snippets have been chosen here. In order to read them into the software, all articles have been converted to simple text files for which all descriptive content in the beginning has been discarded.
