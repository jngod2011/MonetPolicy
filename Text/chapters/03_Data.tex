While all analyses in this discussion are performed by the author, if not indicated otherwise, the raw data is collected from a variety of sources. Since the project can be divided into two distinctive parts, the classification of open market operations and yield curve movements, the origin of the data is disclosed below in a similar fashion.

\subsection{Financial time series}
Federal funds target rates as well as major announcements delivered by the board are taken from the website of the Federal Reserve \cite{Fed.OMOs} as well as \textcite{Fawley.2013} and newspaper articles as collected by the Factiva database. The daily yield curve utilized is provided by Thompson Reuters Datastream. Figure~\vref{fig:TgtvsInt} compares the Federal Funds target rate (range) to the daily constant maturity US treasury middle rate. Vertical lines indicate extraordinary announcements by the Fed board as described in section~\ref{sec:Lit} that had a significant impact on financial markets.

\subsection{Articles and text}
The final dataset contains newspaper articles in English language from Bloomberg, Financial Times, Reuters and Wall Street Journal in text format from an extensive database. Since the scope and quality of these articles is only useful for the years past 2007, a few comparable articles have been added from the Factiva database in order to make analyses before the year 2007 feasible and meaningful.
